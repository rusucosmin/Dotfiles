A minimalistic UI theme based on One Dark. Styling loosely based on [Light Table](http://lighttable.com). Created by [@jonikorpi](https://twitter.com/jonikorpi).

Goes nicely with my [Solarized syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/jonikorpi-atom-solarized-syntax).

# Installation

Search for "jonikorpi" in the Install/Themes section of your Atom settings.

The theme inherits colors from whatever syntax theme you use. All dark syntax themes should work fine. Light ones not quite yet.
